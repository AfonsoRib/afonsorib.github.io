# Go To Your Local Market

For the last two months I’ve switching from going mostly to my nearest supermarket to the local market. This has been one of my best recent decisions and I expect to carry this through the rest of my life. Not only has it cut the time I had to walk to the nearest supermarket, it also made me save some amount of money while getting much better products.

I am currently living in an apartment near my university and, as of this moment, the nearest supermarket is a 10 to 15 minute walk from where I live. Near my apartment there is this market which I have mostly neglected for over a year and a half. Not necessarily because it was bad but, during Covid, it was only open during the Saturday while the supermarkets were open all week for some stupid reason. This was not really useful for me as I sometimes would wake up late and miss the opportunity to buy there. So, out of habit, I just went to the supermarket.

Covid started dying down and soon the market was open all week. I decided to give it a try and soon found out that, not only was the food way cheaper (sometimes 3 times cheaper than the supermarket counterpart), came mostly from local sources and the products were just better overall! Of course, somethings that I ate were usually not available there but the things that I needed to make most of my meals were. I still rely on the supermarket for those things but I have to take way less trips there. Now, I only wish that I could get these things from the local market.

The last thing that surprised me was the meat. Although it is just a tad more costly, for the quality it’s a really great deal. Unexpectedly, a few things, like hamburgers or minced meat, are way cheaper for some reason. the meat is a lot different and way tastier that the antibiotic and corn fed meat from the supermarket. With the money I save on vegetables and fruit, I feel like buying meat form the butcher is good idea. I like to think of it as a kind of insurance so that I reduce the risk of getting some weird disease from the supermarket meat.

Update 22/10/22: Ironically, due to hyperinflation meat from the market is now at the same price as supermarket meat and way tastier! Prices in the supermarket have skyrocketed way a above the stipulated inflation rate. Local markets tend not to get affected by inflation as much as big store chains. Probably because the risk is more evenly distributed and local. Just some food for thought.
